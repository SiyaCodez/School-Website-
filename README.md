## 🧭 My Approach

The first step was wireframing the layout and planning how each section would work together. I focused on structuring semantic HTML early on to ensure accessibility and SEO best practices. After styling the layout with Bootstrap, I added interactive components using vanilla JavaScript — particularly in the news and contact form sections.

I used progressive enhancement, ensuring the core layout worked even before JS enhancements. Accessibility was baked in from the start — from meaningful alt text to labeled forms and focus-friendly navigation.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges was managing responsiveness while customizing Bootstrap components to fit a unique look and feel. I also had to carefully validate form input without relying on external libraries, which was a great refresher on native JavaScript validation patterns.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This project made me combine layout, logic, accessibility, and performance with real-world front-end development techniques. Building it taught me a lot, and I can't wait to keep improving and growing it!
